# My Chatbot Project

## üåü Overview
This is a Python-based chatbot project designed to interact with users and provide responses. Its core functionality is powered by integration with the **OpenAI API**, leveraging advanced natural language capabilities to generate dynamic and relevant conversational output.

## ‚ú® Features
* **Conversational Interface:** Engages users in natural language dialogue.
* **OpenAI API Integration:** Utilizes OpenAI's models for intelligent response generation.
* **Modular Backend:** Structured with separate modules for authentication, chatbot logic, and utilities.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running this project, you'll need:
* Python 3.x installed on your system.
* `pip` (Python package installer).
* An **OpenAI API Key**. You can obtain one from the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/bhavya21-dot/chatbot.git](https://github.com/bhavya21-dot/chatbot.git)
    cd chatbot/rewear-backend # Or whatever your project's root directory is
    ```
    (Adjust the `cd` command if your project's root is directly within `chatbot`).

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Assuming you have a requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, you'll need to list the libraries you used, e.g., `pip install fastapi uvicorn openai python-dotenv`)*

### Configuration

1.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    In the root of your project directory (e.g., `rewear-backend/`), create a new file named `.env`.

2.  **Add your OpenAI API Key:**
    Inside the `.env` file, add your OpenAI API key like this:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```
    **Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API Key.**

    **Remember:** The `.env` file is intentionally excluded from Git via `.gitignore` to protect your sensitive credentials.

### Running the Chatbot

*(Instructions here will depend on how your chatbot is run. Assuming a FastAPI backend for now):*

1.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    (If your main FastAPI app object is named differently, adjust `main:app` accordingly).

2.  **Access the API:**
    The API will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can access the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.
